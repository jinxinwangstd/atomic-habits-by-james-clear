# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

It's so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
