# How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.

Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. What you crave is not the habit itself, but the change in state it delivers.

The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.

Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.

In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop, known as the habit loop.

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase.

We need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones. The framework is called "the Four Laws of Behavior Change" by the author.

How to create a good habit:

- Make it obvious.
- Make it attractive.
- Make it easy.
- Make it satisfying.

How to break a bad habit:

- Make it invisible.
- Make it unattractive.
- Make it difficult.
- Make it unsatisfying.

The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications.
