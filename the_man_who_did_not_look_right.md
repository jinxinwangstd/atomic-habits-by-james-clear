# The Man Who Didn't Look Right

That's the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior and assess it. If it is a good habit, write "+" next to it. If it is a bad habit, write "-". If it is a neutral habit, write "=".

There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. For this exercise, categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.

The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism.
