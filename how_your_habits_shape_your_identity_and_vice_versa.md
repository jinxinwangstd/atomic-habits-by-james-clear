# How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. A system of beliefs is an identity. Therefore, the identity has the most influence on the actions of an entity.

Actions (behaviors) that is incompatible with the identity will not last, whereas actions that is aligned with the identity will stay. The more deeply an action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.

Therefore, it is hard to change your habits (behaviors) if you never change the identity (the systems of beliefs) that led to your past behaviors. True behavior change is identity change.

The above rationale can take effect in the positive direction: when people adopt a good identity, it is easier for them to build good habits aligned with that good identity. However, it can also serve in the negative direction: when people believe in their incapable identity, it is harder for them to behave in the capable way.

That leads us to the question: how to change the identity? In other words, how to adopt the identity you wish and abandon the unwanted identity?

Every belief, including those forming your identity, is learned and conditioned through experience. Every event happened, and every action you took contribute to forming your identity. 

Since people take actions and have events everyday, their identities are changed everyday, in other words, continually evolved. Also, identities are evolved gradually, by every event and every action. Putting it together, identities are continually undergoing micro-evolution.

By virtue of the event frequency, the more frequent events and actions have more influence on identities. In other words, habits play a more important role in forming your identities. Therefore, habits are the path to changing our identities.

It is kind of a paradox that we need to change our identities to truly change our habits, and our habits are the path to changing our identities. However, that can leads to the following conclusions:

1. Changing our current identities and habits are difficult, since they are reinforced by each other.
2. Every action counts. Every action aligned with the new identity contributes to it and hence help build the new habit.

Therefore, we can conclude the general process for changing the identity and building new habits:

1. Find the new identity you want to become and the action you want to do that is aligned with the new identity .
2. Use every available moment to take the decided action.
3. With aligned actions accumulated, we gradually adopt the new identity and build the new habit.

Identity change is the North Star of habit change, and your habits (actions) help you become the type of person you wish to be.
